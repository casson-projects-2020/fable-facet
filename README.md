# Fable Facet - Your-Fable-Cloud
In conjunction with Fable Facet site allows you to use your 1000 Gemini API free calls to storytelling.

This is a "Open In Google Cloud Shell" repo - it will create in a Google Cloud Platform account the infrastructure the site https://fablefacet.com needs to allow a user to use his own 1000 Gemini API free calls (generously given to all by Google) to generate AI-driven stories. 

They can be used as a game - you play as the protagonist and the AI generates the story as you go, as TTRPG adventures, or simply as fictional writing help.

> :warning: There are restrictions - don't install without visiting the site and reading about it. First, it will not work without Fable Facet site, and second, while this installer is MIT-licensed, other parts of the software are not open-source, and will fail  in any GCP account that is linked to Organizations (only personal, individual accounts can be used).
