# Fable Facet - Your-Fable-Cloud
In conjunction with Fable Facet site allows you to use your 1000 Gemini API free calls to storytelling.

This is a "Open In Google Cloud Shell" repo - it will create in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account the infrastructure the site https://fablefacet.com needs to allow a user to use his own 1000 Gemini API free calls (generously given to all by Google) to generate AI-driven stories. 

It can be used as a tool to fictional writing, or as a game - you play as the protagonist and the AI generates the story as you go, or the AI can serve as a TTRPG adventure master.

The system is designed to be inside the always-free tier on GCP, but if you already use the free tier in other projects you will have to manage this aspect.
 
> :warning: There are restrictions - don't install without visiting the site and reading about it. First, it will not work without Fable Facet site, and second, while this installer is MIT-licensed, other parts of the software are not open-source, and will fail  in any GCP account that is linked to Organizations (only personal, individual accounts can be used).


If you landed here from Fable Facet site and wants to install Your-Fable-Cloud, please click the link below and follow the instructions (if you don't have a GCP account yet, you will need to create it first - please refer to Fable Facet site)
