# Fable Facet - Your-Fable-Cloud
Your-Fable-Cloud is the infrastructure component of Fable Facet. It enables a "Bring Your Own Infrastructure" (BYOI) model, allowing developers / authors to use AI-assisted writing tools hosted on their own Google Cloud environment.

This is a "Open In Google Cloud Shell" repo - it will create in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account the infrastructure that you will join to the site 
[Fable Facet](https://fablefacet.com/ffacet.mesis.html) to be used solely by you. 

Your-Fable-Cloud is designed to aid fictional writing, in an interactive reading experience - you the author (or another reader) in the role of the protagonist (or other character) while the AI generates the story as you go, follow previously written guidelines.

By installing this backend in your own GCP account, you maintain control over your data and usage. The system is designed to be inside the always-free tier on GCP, but if you already use the free tier in other projects you will have to manage this aspect.
