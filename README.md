# Fable Facet - Your-Fable-Cloud
In conjunction with Fable Facet site it creates a distributed, Bring Your Own Infrastructure application that allows developers / authors to use AI to assist in creating texts.

This is a "Open In Google Cloud Shell" repo - it will create in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account the infrastructure that you will join to the site 
[Fable Facet](https://fablefacet.com/ffacet.mesis.html) to be used solely by you. 

It is as a tool to aid fictional writing, but it allows for an interactive reading experience - you the author (or another reader) in the role of the protagonist (or other character) while the AI generates the story as you go, follow previously written guidelines.

The system is designed to be inside the always-free tier on GCP, but if you already use the free tier in other projects you will have to manage this aspect.
 
> :warning: There are restrictions - don't install without visiting the site and reading about it. First, it will not work without Fable Facet site, and second, while this installer is MIT-licensed, other parts of the software are not open-source, and will fail in any GCP account that is linked to Organizations (only personal, individual accounts can be used). Also a lot of
terms of service applies, including being 18+ years old, not being able to any other uses beyond writing and publishing texts, etc.

If you landed here from Fable Facet site and wants to install Your-Fable-Cloud, please click the link below and follow the instructions (if you don't have a GCP account yet, you will need to create it first - please refer to Fable Facet site)
